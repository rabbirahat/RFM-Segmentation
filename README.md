# RFM Segmentation Project

## Features
 - ### Data Preparation:
    - Formatting and cleaning the dataset 
    - Calculating RFM metrics for each customer
      - Recency: Days since the last purchase.
      - Frequency: Number of unique purchases.
      - Monetary Value: Total spending by the customer.
        
 - ### RFM Scoring:
   - Assigning quartile-based scores (1â€“4) for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.
   - Combining the scores into an overall RFM score.
  
 - ### Customer Segmentation:
   - Defining customer segments based on RFM scores (e.g., Loyal Customers, Potential Churners, 
     Big Spenders).
   - Analyzing segment behaviour using descriptive statistics.
  
 - ### Visualizations:
   - Bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps to explore:
    - Distribution of customers across segments.
    - Metrics (recency, frequency, monetary) per segment.
    - Heatmap of RFM Scores (Monetary Value)
    - Relationships between RFM metrics using heatmaps.


## Summary of the segment-wise heatmap

The heatmap shows important consumer segment behaviours according to their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- **Big Spenders:** Customers who spend a lot.
- **Loyal Customers:** Customers who frequently purchase and spend a lot.
- **New Customers:** Customers who have recently made a first purchase though their monetary value is low.
- **Potential Churners:** Customers who haven't purchased recently
